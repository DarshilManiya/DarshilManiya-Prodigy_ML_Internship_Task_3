Dog and Cat Classification using SVM
This project demonstrates the use of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify images of dogs and cats. The dataset used is the popular Kaggle Dogs vs. Cats dataset.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to classify images of dogs and cats using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The SVM is a powerful and versatile machine learning model, capable of performing both linear and non-linear classification. The project involves data preparation, model training, evaluation, and prediction on new images.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Kaggle Dogs vs. Cats dataset, which consists of 15,000 labeled images of dogs and cats. The dataset is split into a training set and a test set to evaluate the performance of the model.

Libraries Used
NumPy: For numerical operations and array manipulations.
OpenCV: For image processing tasks, including reading, resizing, and converting images to grayscale.
scikit-learn: For implementing the SVM model and performing model training and evaluation.
Installation
To run this project, you need Python installed along with several libraries including NumPy, OpenCV, and scikit-learn. Additionally, you need the Kaggle CLI to download the dataset.

You can install the required libraries using pip. Ensure you have your Kaggle API credentials set up to download the dataset.

Results
The SVM model achieves a notable accuracy on the test set. Detailed evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score for each class (dogs and cats) provide a deeper insight into the model's performance.
